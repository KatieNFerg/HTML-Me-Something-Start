            <h2>Powerful Arms</h2>
            <p>
               Mantis Shrimp have arms, also called appendages, that have massive muscles on them to give them power to break open their prey. They carry enough force to smash through an aquarium glass wall! In the wild, when they strike with their arms, tiny air bubbles can be seen in the water. These shrimp actually use these bubbles as additional force to pop onto the target. They can crack open hard shells, or impale fish like a spear.

            <h2>Special Eyes</h2>
            <p>
               Another dangerous feature of the Mantis Shrimp is their eyes. They have compound eyes for one, which is like a bunch of different eyes rolled into one. The shrimp's eyes are also able to measure distance from the object they are looking at with just one eye!
               Mantis shrimp can see in a color spectrum that we can only imagine. Instead of three primary colors our eyes have, their eyes have eight. They can see ultraviolet light, and can distinguish it into different colors. Finally, they can also see lgiht waves, also called the polarization of light. There is nothing prey can do to hide themselves from a mantis shrimp eyes.

            <h2>Fast As Lightning</h2>
            <p>
               The mantis shrimp holds the world record of any animal for having the fastest strike. Their arms can whip out at speeds of seventy-five feet per second. That is about fifty times faster than the blink of an eye.
               Their prey doesn't even have a second to react before they meet their demise with the mantis shrimp.
